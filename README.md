- My antivirus flagged this as a Keyloger, its a virus?!?!?!?
NO, its not. The software uses a keyloger to get when you press a key on your keyboard, but DOESNT SAVE ANY INFORMATION

- Cookie Logger?
I like cookies, but my program not, the program doesnt log any cookie, you can check it on the code.
